# RAML API Designer in Docker

This a very simple docker wrapper for the [RAML API Designer project](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer).

The best way to run this is to clone the project, build the docker container and running it.

Alternatively, you can also run this using the following bash scripts

`./build.sh`

`./run.sh [PORT_NUMBER]`
